# Algorithms for Matura Exam in Computer Science

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations designed to help high school students prepare for the Polish Matura exam in Computer Science. Repo is implemented as lib. The examples range from simple string manipulations like anagram checks to classic ciphers and various sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

Below is an overview of the few examples of algorithms and scripts which u will find in `src` folder:

* **Anagram Check** (`anagram.py`): Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
* **Caesar Cipher** (`caesar_cipher.py`): Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher.
* **Bubble Sort** (`bubble_sort.py`): Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
* **Quick Sort** (`quick_sort.py`): In-place quicksort implementation.
* **Insertion Sort** (`insertion_sort.py`): Simple insertion sort algorithm.
* **Merge Sort** (`merge_sort.py`): Divide and conquer merge sort.
* **Binary Search** (`binary_search.py`): Search for an element in a sorted list.
* **Fibonacci Sequence** (`fibonacci.py`): Recursive and iterative methods to generate Fibonacci numbers.
* **Prime Check** (`prime_check.py`): Determine if a number is prime.
* **Other Algorithms**: Additional scripts covering topics like, dynamic programming, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/matura-algorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd matura-algorithms
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install any dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone script. You can run them directly with Python. For example:

```bash
python src/anagram.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

* Add new algorithm implementations.
* Improve existing code (efficiency, readability, comments).
* Include tests or example cases.
